		<h1>Loading Data</h1>	
		<p>
			Application loads data when application first initialize. Two parts of data will load, one
			is master data, the other is transaction data. Coz there is dependency between two data, so
			the loading of the data should follow the sequence, master data first and then transaction
			data.
		</p>
		<h2>Loading Master Data</h2>
		<p>
			Loading master data should follow the sequence, vendor, customer, business area, bank key,
			bank account, G/L account group and G/L account.
