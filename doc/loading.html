		<h1>Loading Data</h1>

		<p>
			Application loads data when application first initialize. Two parts of data will load, one
			is master data, the other is transaction data. Coz there is dependency between two data, so
			the loading of the data should follow the sequence, master data first and then transaction
			data.
		</p>
		<h2>Loading Master Data</h2>
		<p>
			Loading master data should follow the sequence, vendor, customer, business area, bank key,
			bank account, G/L account group and G/L account.<br />
			
			Loading master data is triggered in method <code>com.jasonzqshen.familyaccount.core.CoreDriver~init</code>,
			which means that the method <code>com.jasonshen.familyaccount.core.masterdata.MasterDataManagement~load</code> is invoked. In the function,
			all the registered master data factories are initialized based on the master data file. In addition, it follows
			the sequence, which is defined in ENUM items order of <code>com.jasonzqshen.familyaccounting.core.masterdata.MasterDataType</code>. However, if
			the master data type is not registered in the table, system exception will occurs.
			
			In the process of loading master data, if there is not master data file or the format error in the file, the master data factory for the 
			certain master data type will initialize with empty factory, which means that there is no master data entities in the factory.
