		<p>The Family Accounting system follows <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system'>Double-entry bookkeeping system</a>. 
		The records are called accounting documents in terms of Financial Accounting. For example, user enters the record below: 
		</p>
		
		<table class='Table'>
			<tr><td>Outgoing: </td><td>Subway</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Account: </td><td>Cash</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Amount: </td><td>5.00</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Segment: </td><td>For work</td></tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>In the backend, the system will generate one accounting document and two line items. And the balance of this document is zero.</p>
		
		<table class='Table'>
			<tr>
				<td>Acount</td>
				<td>Credit/Debit</td>
				<td>Amount</td>
				<td>Segment</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Subway</td>
				<td>Debit</td>
				<td>5.00</td>
				<td>For work</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Cash</td>
				<td>Credit</td>
				<td>-5.00</td>
				<td></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
