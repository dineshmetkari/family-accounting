		<h1>G/L Account Type</h1>
		<p>1. Balance Account(ID: 'B')<br/>
			When you post documents to an account, the system automatically updates the account balance.
			In addition, for G/L accounts that are managed with line item display, the system notes which
			items from the document were posted to the account. It is therefore possible to view the account
			balances and (depending on the specifications in the master record) the line items for every G/L
			account.
		</p>
		<p>
			2. Profit & loss(ID: 'P')<br/>
			Account is the one which profits or losses are transferred. The account is used to calculate
			the cost and profit.
