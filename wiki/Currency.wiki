=Introduction=

The Currency Management Module facilitates the conversion among different currency and update of latest exchange rates.

=Basic Concept of Currency Management=

==Default Currency==

Default Currency is specified to the whole application for convenient calculation and summary. All transactions are set to Default Currency by default unless Account Currency or Foreign Currency is specified.

==Account Currency==

Account Currency is specified to each account. If exists, Account Currency is assigned to all transaction under the account. Multiple Account Currency is possible. 

==Foreign Currency==

Foreign Currency can be specified to all transactions freely. With the help of Exchange Rate Table the actually transaction values can be converted to Account Currency or Default Currency.

==Exchange Rate Table==

An initial Exchange Rate Table is generated as the first use of the application. Exchange Rate Table can be manually and automatically updated via internet API like Yahoo Finance.
