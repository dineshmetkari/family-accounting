2. Sync *Core* code with SVN path `%SVN_branch%/proj/CoreLibrary/` into local work space `%workspace%/CoreLibrary`;

3. Sync *Android* code with SVN path `%SVN_branch%/proj/Android/` into local work space `%workspace%/Android`;

4. Sync *Back-end Test* code with SVN path `%SVN_branch%/test/backend_test/` into local work space `%workspace%/backend_test`;
